# Singleplayer-Client
A mod for Minecraft 1.6.4 which removes the compulsory internal multiplayer server from Minecraft singleplayer. This greatly improves performance, fixes numerous bugs introduced by Minecraft 1.3, and restores UI elements from the pre-1.3 era.

This mod is the bedrock for the upcoming mods Project Ocelot and Better than Horses, and is provisionally based on Exalm's old SSP mod from the OldDays family of mods.

_Why 1.6.4?_

This mod is part of a greater project of restoring the look, feel, and features of classic versions to a modern version of the game (Project Ocelot) and rebalancing the progression of the game (Better than Horses.) 1.6.4 is the final version of the game which can be repaired to such a state, with fundamental changes to world generation among other bad things taking place in release 1.7 alongside little to no positive change.

_How to install?_

This mod is simply in the format of a .jar mod, so you may be able to install it by any means that .jar mods can be installed. The method that I have absolutely confirmed to work for the time being is adding SPC.zip to minecraft.jar via the MultiMC launcher.

_How to use the source code:_

To edit the source code, perform an MCP decompile of vanilla 1.6.4 and merge the minecraft folder from this repository with the src\minecraft\net\minecraft folder from the MCP directory. You can then edit the source code, recompile, and reobfuscate.
