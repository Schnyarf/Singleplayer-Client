# Singleplayer-Client
A mod for Minecraft 1.6.4 which removes the compulsory internal multiplayer server from Minecraft singleplayer. This greatly improves performance, fixes numerous bugs introduced by Minecraft 1.3, and restores UI elements from the pre-1.3 era.

This mod is the bedrock for the upcoming mods Project Ocelot and Better than Horses, and is provisionally based on Exalm's old SSP mod from the OldDays family of mods.

_Why 1.6.4?_
This mod is part of a greater project of restoring the look, feel, and features of classic versions to a modern version of the game (Project Ocelot) and rebalancing the progression of the game (Better than Horses.) 1.6.4 is the final version of the game which can be repaired to such a state, with fundamental changes to world generation among other bad things taking place in release 1.7 alongside little to no positive change.
